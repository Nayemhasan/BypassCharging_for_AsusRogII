## BypassCharging_for_AsusRogII
A modified asus-game-genie app that can do bypass charging for Rog 2 like newer Rog 3/5/6.<br>
Asus Rog series has been beloved by gamers and mobile enthusiasts for it unmatched spces and hw performance.<br>
I personally like this series too. But the sad thing is older generation are not getting improved features like new Armoury Crate, Features Updates and most important OS updates. But there are workarounds with some hardworking devs to fix thing up.

## So whats Bypass Charging again?

Bypass Charging means the device is getting powered directly from the adapter without touching the battery.<br>
This done in some phone like newer Rog phones , to save battery life so that battery is not used while charging , because using phone while charging or fast charging may hamper the battery. Here battery is not charged, the battery level will be constant, only the phone is powered externally.

## My tests
   Testbench:
 - Asus Rog 2 (8+128 tencent edition)
 - 18w charger connected 
 - CPU Throttling Test app
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting bypass charging</td>
     <td>20 Threads 15 Minutes test</td>
     <td>Done</td>
  </tr>

  </tr>
 </table>
 
 ## Results
 <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Starting Test</td>
     <td>After Test</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Nayemhasan/BypassCharging_for_AsusRogII/blob/main/pics/1.batterylog1.jpg" width=270 height=585></td>

  </tr>
 </table>
 So what I found was during the test battery didnt drained or heated up quickly. It took time finishing the test and uses only 1% of battery. I think that's usal for idle usage. In this case it was during a heavy cpu test, So guess what's workingüçâüòÅ

## How to use?

Good things sometime breaks thing up. Here you can see I cant use Game Genie via Armoury Crate app
